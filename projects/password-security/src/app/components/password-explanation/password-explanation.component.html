  <h2>Why Do We Need Strong Passwords?</h2>
  <p>
    A strong password is your first line of defense against hackers. It protects
    your personal information, accounts, and sensitive data from unauthorized
    access.
  </p>

  <h3>What Makes a Password Strong?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It is at least 12 characters long.</li>
    <li>
      Includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    </li>
    <li>
      Does not contain easily guessed information like your name or birthdate.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why Weak Passwords Are Risky</h3>
  <p>
    Weak passwords are easy to guess using tools like brute-force attacks or by
    hackers who find them in leaked databases. This puts your accounts and
    private data at risk.
  </p>

  <h3>Tips for Creating Strong Passwords</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords for every
      account.
    </li>
    <li>Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.</li>
    <li>Update your passwords regularly to stay secure.</li>
    <li>
      Check if your password has been breached with tool like "Have I Been
      Pwned" before using it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> A strong password keeps your accounts safe!</p>
